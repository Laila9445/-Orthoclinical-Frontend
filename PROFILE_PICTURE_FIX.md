# Profile Picture Upload Fix

## ✅ Issue Fixed

Profile picture upload was not working because:
1. Image was only saved when clicking "Save" button in edit mode
2. Missing `expo-image-picker` plugin configuration in `app.json`

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Immediate Save Functionality
**File**: `screens/NurseProfileScreen.js`

Changed the image picker to save immediately after selection:
```javascript
// Before: Only set state, no save
if (!result.canceled) {
  setProfileImage(result.assets[0].uri);
}

// After: Set state AND save immediately
if (!result.canceled) {
  setProfileImage(result.assets[0].uri);
  await updateProfile({ profileImage: result.assets[0].uri });
  Alert.alert('Success', 'Profile picture updated!');
}
```

### 2. Added Image Picker Plugin
**File**: `app.json`

Added expo-image-picker plugin configuration:
```json
[
  "expo-image-picker",
  {
    "photosPermission": "The app accesses your photos to let you set your profile picture."
  }
]
```

## ⚠️ Important: Rebuild Required

Since we added a new plugin to `app.json`, you **MUST rebuild the app** for the changes to take effect:

### For Development
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart
npm start

# For iOS
npm run ios

# For Android
npm run android
```

### Why Rebuild?
- Plugins are configured at build time
- Changes to `app.json` plugins require app rebuild
- Development server restart is not enough

## 🧪 Testing Steps

1. **Rebuild the app** (important!)
2. Navigate to Nurse Profile screen
3. Click the camera icon on profile picture
4. Choose "Camera" or "Gallery"
5. Select/take a photo
6. You should see:
   - Success alert: "Profile picture updated!"
   - Image appears immediately
   - Image persists after app restart

## 📱 Camera & Gallery Permissions

The app will now properly request permissions:
- **Camera**: For taking photos
- **Gallery**: For selecting from photo library

On first use, you'll see permission prompts.

## 🔄 How It Works Now

1. User clicks camera icon
2. Alert shows Camera/Gallery options
3. User selects option
4. App requests permission (if needed)
5. Picker opens
6. User selects/takes photo
7. Image saves immediately to AsyncStorage
8. Success alert shown
9. Image displayed instantly
10. Image persists across app restarts

## ✅ Benefits

- **Immediate Feedback**: Success alert confirms upload
- **No Extra Steps**: No need to click "Save"
- **Persistent**: Image saves to AsyncStorage
- **Professional**: Works like modern apps

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Still Not Working?
1. **Did you rebuild?** This is required!
2. **Check permissions**: Make sure camera/gallery permissions granted
3. **Check console**: Look for any error messages
4. **Try again**: Sometimes first attempt needs permissions

### Error Messages

**"Permission Required"**
- Grant camera/gallery permissions in device settings
- Try again after granting permissions

**Image doesn't persist**
- Rebuild app completely
- Check AsyncStorage is working
- Verify expo-image-picker is properly installed

## 📝 Summary

Profile picture upload now:
- ✅ Saves immediately after selection
- ✅ Shows success confirmation
- ✅ Persists across app restarts
- ✅ Works with camera and gallery
- ✅ Proper permission handling
- ✅ Professional user experience

**Remember to rebuild the app for these changes to take effect!**
