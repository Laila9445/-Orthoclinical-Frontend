## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Login not working

**Issue**: Navigation not working
- **Solution**: Check that `AuthProvider` is wrapping the app in `app/_layout.tsx`

**Issue**: AsyncStorage errors
- **Solution**: Ensure `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` is installed

**Issue**: Biometric not working
- **Solution**: Requires physical device or emulator with biometric capabilities

### Reset Data

To clear all stored data:
1. Uninstall the app from your device/emulator
2. Reinstall with `npm run android` or `npm run ios`

## 📝 Next Steps

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Backend Integration**: Connect to real API

3. **Push Notifications**: Alert nurses of new appointments
4. **Offline Mode**: Cache data for offline access
5. **Advanced Security**: Implement JWT tokens
6. **Analytics**: Track user behavior
7. **Multi-language**: Add i18n support

### Production Considerations
1. Replace hardcoded credentials with secure backend
2. Implement proper error handling and logging
3. Add analytics and monitoring
4. Optimize images and assets
5. Add comprehensive tests
