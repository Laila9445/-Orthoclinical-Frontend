# Updates Summary - Nurse Dashboard Improvements

## ✅ Completed Changes

### 1. Minimized Dashboard Header
**File**: `screens/DashboardScreen.js`

**Changes**:
- Reduced header padding from `20px` to `12px` vertically and `20px` to `16px` horizontally
- Reduced menu icon size from `28` to `24`
- Reduced notification icon size from `24` to `20`
- Made header more compact while maintaining readability

```javascript
// Before
paddingVertical: 20,
paddingHorizontal: 20,

// After
paddingVertical: 12,
paddingHorizontal: 16,
```

### 2. Added Nurse Name to Greeting
**Files**: `context/AuthContext.js`, `screens/DashboardScreen.js`

**Changes**:
- Added default nurse name "Sarah Johnson" to login context
- Updated dashboard header to display: "Good Morning, Sarah Johnson"
- Greeting now dynamically shows the nurse's name from user data
- Falls back to "Nurse" if name is not available

```javascript
// AuthContext.js - Added to login
const userData = {
  email: email,
  name: 'Sarah Johnson', // Default nurse name
  phone: '+1 (555) 123-4567',
  loginTime: new Date().toISOString(),
};

// Dashboard header
<Text style={styles.greeting}>
  {getGreeting()}, {user?.name || 'Nurse'}
</Text>
```

### 3. Edit and Delete Task Functionality
**File**: `screens/DashboardScreen.js`

**Changes**:
- Added edit icon and delete icon buttons to each task
- Created "Edit Task" modal with same UI as "Add Task"
- Implemented `deleteTask()` function to remove tasks
- Implemented `openEditTask()` and `saveEditedTask()` functions
- Tasks now have edit (blue pen icon) and delete (red trash icon) actions
- Both actions work independently without affecting task completion status

**New Functions**:
```javascript
// Delete task
const deleteTask = (taskId) => {
  setTasks(tasks.filter(task => task.id !== taskId));
};

// Edit task
const openEditTask = (task) => {
  setEditingTask(task);
  setNewTaskTitle(task.title);
  setShowEditTaskModal(true);
};

// Save edited task
const saveEditedTask = () => {
  if (newTaskTitle.trim()) {
    setTasks(tasks.map(task =>
      task.id === editingTask.id ? { ...task, title: newTaskTitle } : task
    ));
    setNewTaskTitle('');
    setShowEditTaskModal(false);
    setEditingTask(null);
  }
};
```

**UI Changes**:
- Added edit modal (same design as add modal)
- Changed task item layout to include action buttons
- Added `taskActions` container with edit and delete buttons
- Each task now shows: checkbox, text, edit button, delete button

### 4. Profile Picture Upload Functionality
**Files**: `screens/NurseProfileScreen.js`

**Changes**:
- Installed `expo-image-picker` package
- Implemented full image picker with camera and gallery options
- Added permission requests for camera and photo library
- Created image selection dialog with Camera/Gallery/Cancel options
- Profile image is stored in user data via AsyncStorage
- Image persists across app restarts
- Added visual feedback when image is selected

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Image picker functionality
const handleChangePhoto = async () => {
  Alert.alert('Select Photo', 'Choose an option', [
    {
      text: 'Camera',
      onPress: async () => {
        // Request camera permissions
        // Launch camera
        // Store selected image URI
      },
    },
    {
      text: 'Gallery',
      onPress: async () => {
        // Request gallery permissions
        // Launch image picker
        // Store selected image URI
      },
    },
    { text: 'Cancel', style: 'cancel' },
  ]);
};

// Display image
{profileImage ? (
  <Image source={{ uri: profileImage }} style={styles.profilePicture} />
) : (
  <View style={styles.profilePicture}>
    <Ionicons name="person" size={60} color="#007BFF" />
  </View>
)}
```
